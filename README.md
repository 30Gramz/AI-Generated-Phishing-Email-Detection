# Description

This project focuses on detecting AI-generated phishing emails using free tools in a home lab environment. It analyzes email headers and body content to identify suspicious patterns, such as spoofed sender addresses, unusual language structures, and AI-generated text. The project uses *SpamAssassin* for spam filtering, *YARA rules* for AI text pattern detection, and a *Python script* to assess email readability and detect potential AI-generated phishing attempts. The goal is to develop an efficient, open-source method for identifying advanced phishing attacks.
